My solutions for 2021's Advent Of Code coding challenge. Bit of fun.

The code is not pretty, optimised, maintainable or whizzy. It simply gets the answer.
They're all in Javascript, executed via node.

Each day there are 2 new challenges, a part 1 and a more difficult part 2.
So far each solution is run simply my moving into the relevant day's folder and running the scripts directly.

    cd 01
    node p1.js

I mean, it's basic. But it works.
